* Emacspeak 46 -- Emacspeak 46 User Visible Changes
** Emacspeak Info Pages

There is a new command _emacspeak-open-info_ bound to _C-e TAB_
that opens the Emacspeak online manual for the  version of Emacspeak
in use.

** Managing Shell Buffers

Module _emacspeak-wizards_ provides a set of shell-management commands  
that make it easy to create shell buffers specific to projects and
moving among them.

** Installation:

The install rule in the Makefile is deprecated and has been updated to
display simple installation instructions. 
To install a specific version of Emacspeak:
  1. Download and unpack the latest tarball.
  2. make config && make to build Emacspeak
  3. Optional: make espeak to build espeak support.
  4. Optional: make outloud to build ViaVoice outloud support.
  5.  copy the resulting  emacspeak directory to the install location.

** Updated DBus Integration 

Module ~emacspeak-dbus~ --- Emacspeak's DBus Integration --- has been
updated  and now includes support for screen-lock, sleep/resume, and  NM.

** Outloud is Easier To Install On 64-Bit Systems 

The ViaVoice Outloud server is now much easier to install on 64-bit
systems, thanks to
[[http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2017/01/fun-with-tts-voxin-and-ladspa.html][Voxin 1.6]]. With this,  the Emacspeak speech-server works with the
default 64-bit  _tclsh_ executable.
The installed Emacspeak requires _Voxin 1.6_, make sure to install
that upgrade first if you  have an  older Voxin installation.

Emacspeak 46 will therefore no longer install scripts _32-outloud_  or
any of  the other _32-*_ server scripts.

** Audio-formatted Mathematics 

Module ~emacspeak-maths~ uses _MathJax_ with _Speech-Rule-Engine_
implemented using *NodeJS* to provide audio-formatted mathematics.

** Updated C/C++ Mode Support 

Module ~emacspeak-c.el~ has been updated to support new functionality
in ~cc-mode~.

** Updated ProcEd Support

Module ~emacspeak-proced~ has been updated.

** Updated EShell Support

Module ~eshell~ has been updated.

** Speach-Enabled Clojure

** Speech-Enabled Cider

Cider, The Clojure IDE that
Rocks now talks ---Module ~emacspeak-cider~ speech-enables ~cider~.
** Speech-Enable Racket 

Module ~emacspeak-racket~ speech-enables ~racket-mode~.
** Updated SoX-Gen

Module ~sox-gen~ has been updated with support for Binaural Beats
along with predefined Binaural effects and effect sequences.

** IHeart Radio

Module _emacspeak-wizards_ now  provides ~emacspeak-wizards-iheart~
--- this uses ~iheart-url~ to play IHeart Radio stations.

** Notifications 

Emacspeak now records any *Notifications* produced by
_dtk-notifyspeak_ and friends in a special ~*Notifications*~ buffer
that is setup  like Emacs' built-in ~*Messages*~ buffer.
-- this buffer can be displayed using _C-h T_.
