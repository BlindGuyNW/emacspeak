Emacspeak News --History Of User-Visible Changes

Author: T. V. Raman <tv.raman.tv@gmail.com>


* Emacspeak 48 -- Emacspeak 48 User Visible Changes
This version requires Emacs-25.1 or later.
* Removing W3 Support 

Browser emacs-w3 no longer works with Emacs 26, and consequently,
module ~emacspeak-w3~ has been obsoleted, and all references to
emacs-w3 removed from the Emacspeak codebase.

* Espeak-NG And Emacspeak

On newer Debian systems, espeak users are recommended to move to
espeak-ng by installing the corresponding espeak-ng and espeak
compatibility packages. This avoids portaudio issues, and also brings
all of the power of alsa --- including applying ladspa effects to TTS.

* Emacspeak Prompts 

Emacspeak now includes an ~emacspeak-prompts~ module that provides
high-quality spoken prompts as MP3 files.

* DBus Integration

Module ~emacspeak-dbus~ now provides auditory feedback when waking up
and unlocking ~gnome-screensaver~ via DBus integration.
It also provides  interactive command  ~emacspeak-dbus-lock-screen~
for locking the screen.

* Obsolete: emacspeak-mpg123.el

Support for package ~mpg123.el~ has been removed.

** MPlayer And Equalizer Presets 

Module ~emacspeak-m-player~ now implements a  set of equalizer presets
that can be selected via _e_ in MPlayer interaction.
