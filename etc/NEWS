Author: T. V. Raman <tv.raman.tv@gmail.com>


* Emacspeak 48 -- Emacspeak 48 User Visible Changes
This version requires Emacs-25.1 or later.
* Removing W3 Support 

Browser emacs-w3 no longer works with Emacs 26, and consequently,
module ~emacspeak-w3~ has been obsoleted, and all references to
emacs-w3 removed from the Emacspeak codebase.
