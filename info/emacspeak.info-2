12.66 emacspeak-epub
====================

In celebration of a million books and more to read from Google Books The
EPubs format is slightly simpler than full Daisy — (see)
emacspeak-daisy.el Since it only needs one level of indirection (no
audio, therefore no smil).  This module is consequently simpler than
emacspeak-daisy.el.  This module will eventually implement the Google
Books API — probably by invoking the yet-to-be-written gbooks.el in
emacs-g-client As we move to epub-3, this module will bring back audio
layers etc., perhaps via a simplified smil implementation.

12.77 emacspeak-filtertext
==========================

It is often useful to view the results of filtering large amounts of
text.;;; Typically you do this with various combinations of grep and
friends.  When doing so it requires explicit effort to not destroy the
original text being filtered.  This module provides a textfilter utility
that: A) Copies over the selected text to a special filtertext buffer B)
Implements a filtertext mode for that buffer that allows easy
application of filters C: Provides commands for reverting to the
original unfiltered text D: Provides commands for saving results from
intermediate filters.

12.77.1 emacspeak-filtertext Commands
-------------------------------------

12.77.1.1 emacspeak-filtertext
..............................

 -- Command: emacspeak-filtertext (start end)

12.80 emacspeak-fix-interactive
===============================

Emacs commands that use the ’interactive spec to read interactive
arguments are a problem for Emacspeak.  This is because the prompting
for the arguments is done from C See (callint.c) in the Emacs sources.
Advising the various input functions, e.g.  read-file-name therefore
will not help.  This module defines a function that solves this problem.
emacspeak-fix-commands-that-use-interactive needs to be called To speech
enable such functions.

12.93 emacspeak-gridtext
========================

Emacspeak’s table browsing mode allows one to efficiently access content
that is tabular in nature.  That module also provides functions for
inferring table structure where possible.  Often, such structure is hard
to infer automatically –but might be known to the user e.g.  treat
columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table and so on.  This module
allows the user to specify a conceptual grid that is "overlaid" on the
region of text to turn it into a table for tabular browsing.  For now,
elements of the grid are "one line" high –but that may change in the
future if necessary.  This module is useful for browsing structured text
files and the output from programs that tabulate their output.  It’s
also useful for handling multicolumn text.

12.97 emacspeak-hide
====================

Flexible hide and show for emacspeak.  This module allows one to easily
hide or expose blocks of lines starting with a common prefix.  It is
motivated by the need to flexibly hide quoted text in email but is
designed to be more general.  the prefix parsing is inspired by
filladapt.el

12.97.1 emacspeak-hide Commands
-------------------------------

12.97.1.1 emacspeak-hide-or-expose-all-blocks
.............................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-hide-or-expose-all-blocks

12.97.1.2 emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block
........................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block (&optional prefix)
     ‘C-e j’
     ‘<fn> j’

     Hide or expose a block of text.
     This command either hides or exposes a block of text
     starting on the current line.  A block of text is defined as
     a portion of the buffer in which all lines start with a
     common PREFIX.  Optional interactive prefix arg causes all
     blocks in current buffer to be hidden or exposed.

     (fn &optional PREFIX)

12.97.1.3 emacspeak-hide-speak-block-sans-prefix
................................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-hide-speak-block-sans-prefix
     ‘C-e C-j’
     ‘<fn> C-j’

     Speaks current block after stripping its prefix.
     If the current block is not hidden, it first hides it.
     This is useful because as you locate blocks, you can invoke this
     command to listen to the block,
     and when you have heard enough navigate easily  to move past the block.

12.97.2 emacspeak-hide Options

========================

MUGGLES == Keybinding Conveniences For The Emacspeak Desktop.

   This module implements no new functionality — contrast with
emacspeak-wizards.  Instead, it uses package hydra to provide
convenience key-bindings that access existing Emacspeak functionality.
This module is automatically loaded if package Hydra is loaded.  You
need to install package Hydra first: ‘M-x package-install hydra’.

   Note that on newer versions of Emacs, loading this module will
attempt to automatically install package hydra if it is not found.

12.124.1 Implemented Muggles
----------------------------

   • Brightness: <print> Control display brightness using xbacklight.
   • View-Mode: <C-c v> Temporarily behave like view-mode.
   • Navigate: <s-n> Navigate with ease.
   • org-mode structure nav: <C-c SPC> Structure navigation for
     org-mode.
   • org-mode tables: <C-c t> Table UI for org-mode tables.
   • m-player: <s-m> Emacspeak-M-Player Commands
   • m-player: <s-;> Emacspeak-M-Player muggle
   • pianobar: <s-’> Emacspeak-M-pianobar Commands
   • hideshow: C-c h Provide HideShow bindings.
   • toggle-option: <C-c o> Single binding for toggling options.
   • outliner: <C-c .> Bindings from outline-minor-mode.
   • Info-Summary: <?> in Info Info Summary Muggle
   • Repeatable-Yank: <C-y> Smart yank

   Emacspeak automatically speaks Hydra hints when displayed.  To
silence all Hydra hints, set hydra-is-helpful to nil.  To temporarily
silence speaking of Hydra hints, Muggles can bind command
‘emacspeak-muggles-toggle-talkative’.  As an example, Muggle ‘ViewMode’
binds ‘s’ to this command.

12.130 emacspeak-ocr
====================

This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR. This module assumes that
sane is installed and working for image acquisition, and that there is
an OCR engine that can take acquired images and produce text.
Prerequisites: Sane installed and working.  scanimage to generate tiff
files from scanner.  tiffcp to compress the tiff file.  working ocr
executable by default this module assumes that the OCR executable is
named "ocr"

12.130.1 emacspeak-ocr Commands
-------------------------------

12.130.1.1 emacspeak-ocr
........................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr
     ‘C-e C-o’
     ‘<fn> C-o’

     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
     The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
     available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
     suitable for browsing the results.

     For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
     C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
     ‘?’ to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

12.130.1.2 emacspeak-ocr-backward-page
......................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-backward-page (&optional count-ignored)

     Like backward page, but tracks page number of current document.

     (fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)

12.130.1.3 emacspeak-ocr-customize
..................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-customize

     Customize OCR settings.

12.130.1.4 emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image
.....................................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image

     Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
     Useful if you’ve scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
     You need the imagemagik family of tools — we use mogrify to transform the image.
     Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
     ‘current page’ is not found.

12.130.1.5 emacspeak-ocr-forward-page
.....................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-forward-page (&optional count-ignored)

     Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.

     (fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)

12.130.1.6 emacspeak-ocr-mode
.............................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-mode

      An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Pre-requisites:

     1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

     2) An OCR engine.

     1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
     the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
     tiff file.  Then set variable
     emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
     By default, this is set to ‘scanimage’ which is the image
     scanning utility provided by SANE.

     By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
     tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
     Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to ‘tiffcp’ by
     default; if you use something else, you should customize
     this variable.

     2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
     working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
     available as /usr/bin/ocr.

     Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
     OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
     Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
     Emacspeak.

     The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
     emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.

     This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
     commands bounds to single keystrokes– see the key-binding
     list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
     facility to look up help on these commands.

     emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
     scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
     images and the resulting text are saved under directory
     ~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
     Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
     to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

     By default, the document being scanned is named ‘untitled’.
     You can name the document by using command
     emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
     M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
     in constructing the name of the image and text files.

     Key Bindings:

     See key             binding
     —             ——-

     RET		emacspeak-ocr-scan-and-recognize
     SPC		emacspeak-ocr-read-current-page
     1 .. 9		emacspeak-ocr-page
     ?		describe-mode
     C		emacspeak-ocr-set-compress-image-options
     I		emacspeak-ocr-set-scan-image-options

     q		bury-buffer
     s		emacspeak-ocr-save-current-page
     w		emacspeak-ocr-write-document

     .

     In addition to any hooks its parent mode ‘text-mode’ might have run,
     this mode runs the hook ‘emacspeak-ocr-mode-hook’, as the final or penultimate step
     during initialization.

12.136 emacspeak-personality
============================

Implementation Notes From 2015:

   Setting emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces to nil (none via
customize interface) now results in dtk-speak falling back to the
face->voice mapping defined via voice-setup for the face at point.  What
this means:

   1.  You always get voice-locking except when you set voice-lock-mode
to nil.

   2.  The advice on put-text-property and friends become a no-op and we
still get voice-locking.

   3.  Eventually this will become the default behavior for
voice-locking.

   Implementation Notes from 2002.

   This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
lock via font lock.

12.136.1 emacspeak-personality Options
--------------------------------------

 -- Variable: User Option emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces
     Determines how and if we voiceify faces.

     All means faces are mapped directly to voices – this is the default

     Prepend means that the corresponding personality is prepended to
     the existing personalities on the text.

     Append means place corresponding personality at the end.

     Simple means that voiceification is not cumulative.

 -- Variable: User Option emacspeak-personality-voiceify-overlays
     Determines how and if we voiceify overlays.

     None means that overlay faces are not mapped to voices.  Prepend
     means that the corresponding personality is prepended to the
     existing personalities on the text under overlay.

     Append means place corresponding personality at the end.

=========================

12.138.1 PIANOBAR == Pandora Client for Emacs
---------------------------------------------

pianobar git://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git Ubuntu/Debian: sudo
apt-get install pianobar

   Pianobar Is a stand-alone client for Pandora Radio.  pianobar.el
available on the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pianobar.el Provides access to Pandora
Radio via pianobar from the comfort of Emacs.  This module
speech-enables Pianobar and enhances it for the Complete Audio Desktop.

12.138.2 Emacspeak Usage:
-------------------------

Emacspeak implements command emacspeak-pianobar, a light-weight wrapper
on top of pianobar.  Emacspeak binds this command to ‘C-e '’.  In my
personal ‘.emacs’, I bind this to ‘f5’.  Command emacspeak-pianobar is
designed to let you launch Pandora channels and switch tracks/channels
without moving away from your primary tasks such as editting code or
reading/composing email.  Toward this end, launching command
emacspeak-pianobar the first time initializes the ‘*pianobar*’ buffer
and launches command ‘pianobar’; Focus is placed in the ‘*pianobar*’
buffer.  Pianobar can be controlled with single keystrokes while in this
buffer.  The most useful keys are ‘right’ for skipping tracks, ‘up’ and
‘down’ for switching channels etc.; see the keys bound in
‘pianobar-key-map’ for a complete list.  Pressing ‘C-e '’ in the
‘*pianobar*’ buffer buries the ‘*pianobar*’.  From here on, Pianobar can
be controlled by pressing the Pianobar prefix key (‘C-e '’) followed by
keys from ‘pianobar-key-map’.

12.138.3 emacspeak-pianobar Commands

12.141 emacspeak-pronounce
==========================

This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries for
emacspeak.  Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per directory
and/or per major mode.  Emacspeak maintains a persistent user dictionary
upon request and loads these in new emacspeak sessions.  This module
implements the user interface to the custom dictionary as well as
providing the internal API used by the rest of emacspeak in using the
dictionary.  Algorithm:

   The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names.  The hash values are
association lists defining the dictionary.  Users of this module can
retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association lists for a
given file.

12.164 emacspeak-sounds
=======================

This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in
emacspeak.  Design goal: 1) Auditory icons should be used to provide
additional feedback, not as a gimmick.  2) The interface should be
usable at all times without the icons: e.g.  when on a machine without a
sound card.  3) General principle for when to use an icon: Convey
information about events taking place in parallel.  For instance, if
making a selection automatically moves the current focus to the next
choice, We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that
something was selected with a sound cue.  This interface will assume the
availability of a shell command "play" that can take one or more sound
files and play them.  This module will also provide a mapping between
names in the elisp world and actual sound files.  Modules that wish to
use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes architecture for
auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory
