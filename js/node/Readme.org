* Maths Server In Node

math-server.js is a NodeJS script that implements a simple socket
server.
This server accepts LaTeX math expressions, and then processes them
using MathJaX MathJax and the Speech-Rule-Engine  to produce spoken
math using Aural CSS.

Note that this is early, experimental code, i.e. there i sno support,
and if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
