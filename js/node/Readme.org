* Maths Server In Node

math-server.js is a NodeJS script that implements a simple socket
server. This server accepts LaTeX math expressions, and  processes
them using MathJax  and the Speech-Rule-Engine to produce
spoken math using Aural CSS.

Note that this is early, experimental code, i.e. there is no support,
and if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

* Setup Instructions

** Install ~node~, ~npm~ and ~nvm~

   Install node and npm. You need a newer node than the default node
     installed in Ubuntu, use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage the node installation. See
     file ~nvm-setup~.

** Install Dependencies 

   type _npm install _ in this directory to install dependencies.

** Test the server at the shell

: node math-server.js

Then, from a different shell window, connect to the server.
: nc localhost 5000
: expr: \frac{a+b}{c+d}

If all goes well, you'll see an S-expression printed out. Hit _C-d_ to
close client and server.

** Connect From Within Emacspeak

  - M-x emacspeak-maths-start --- start the server/client.
  - Invoke the /Maths Navigator/ AKA emacspeak-maths muggle using key _s-SPC_ --- here _s-_
    means press the Windows key.
  - Read the docs and profit --- see info node /emacspeak-maths/ in
    the emacspeak manual.
