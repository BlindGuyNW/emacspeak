;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; THREES == threes game. This module speech-enable the
;;; game. @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threes} for history of
;;; the game and details of game play. This module adds additional convenience keybindings to
;;; the default arrow-key bindings implemented in threes.el. In
;;; addition, this module  implements commands that speak the board as well as
;;; getting a column-specific view of the board.
;;;
;;; @table @kbd
;;; @item  f
;;; Move right
;;; @item b
;;; Move left
;;; @item n
;;; Move down
;;; @item p
;;; Move up
;;; @item SPC
;;; Speak the board
;;; @item /
;;; Speak board by column.
;;; @item .
;;; Speak current score.
;;; s
;;; Save current state
;;; u
;;; Pop state from stack
;;; ?
;;; Speak next tile
;;; @end table
;;; The updated board is spoken after each turn.
;;;The next upcoming tile is spoken after the  current state of the board.
;;; You can use @kbd{SPC} and @kbd{/} to review the board.
