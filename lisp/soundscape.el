;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:

;;; Boodler  at @url{http://boodler.org} is a
;;; Python-based SoundScape generator.
;;; To use this module, first install boodler.
;;; Then install the soundscape packages (*.boop) files available
;;; at @url{http://boodler.org/lib}
;;; Make sure boodler works and produces audio in your environment.
;;; When  boodler is set up and all packages installed, copy
;;; file emacspeak/scapes/soundscapes  to ~/.boodler/Collection.
;;; The above file lists all installed SoundScapes.
;;; Directory emacspea/scapes also contains
;;; additional SoundScapes  that I have created for use with Emacspeak.
;;;
;;;  Module soundscape.el  defines Emacspeak conveniences for running
;;; Soundscapes. Main Entry Points:
;;;
;;;@itemize
;;; @item M-x soundscape ---
;;; runs a named SoundScape
;;; @item M-x soundscape-toggle --- Enables or
;;; disables automatic SoundScapes.
;;; @item M-x soundscape-stop --- Stops a specified running Soundscape.
;;; @item M-x soundscape-kill --- Kills all running Soundscapes.
;;;@end itemize
;;;
;;; When automatic Soundscapes are enabled, SoundScapes are
;;;  started and stopped based on the current major
;;; mode. Active Soundscape names are displayed as part of the minor-mode-alist
;;; Command emacspeak-speakc-minor-mode-line can be used to have this spoken.
;;; Thus, SoundScapes can be thought of as reflecting the
;;; @emph{mood} of the current @emph{mode}.
;;; This package defines a single @var{soundscape-default-theme}
;;; that is loaded using @code{(soundscape-load soundscape-default-theme)}.
;;; Emacs modes that provide similar functionality e.g.,
;;; communication == email, IM, ... map to  the same @emph{mood}.
;;; Code:
