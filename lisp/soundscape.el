;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary: http://boodler.org is a Python-based SoundScape
;;; generator. This module defines Emacspeak conveniences for running
;;; Soundscapes. Main Entry Points:
;;;
;;;@itemize
;;; @item M-x soundscape ---
;;; runs a named SoundScape
;;; @item M-x soundscape-toggle --- Enables or
;;; disables automatic SoundScapes.
;;;@end itemize
;;;
;;; When automatic Soundscapes are enabled, SoundScapes are
;;; automatically started and stopped based on the current major
;;; mode. Thus, SoundScapes can be thought of as reflecting the
;;; @emph{mood} of the current @emph{mode}.
