* Emacspeak Soundscapes 

This directory will contain Boodler packages that I create as part of
Emacspeak.
For now, I'm unable to get tool ~boodle-mgr~ to work, so I'm not
packaging these as _.boop_ files.
Copying package directories found here to _~/.boodler/Collection/_
appears to work.

  1. org.emacspeak.seascape: A slightly modified version of package
     _name.acroucher.seascape_ for use with Web content.
