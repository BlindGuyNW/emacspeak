* Emacspeak support for StumpWM

This is what I use to set up StumpWM as a talking window manager.
With this setup, I run Emacs in one window and Chrome+ChromeVox in another window.

* Resulting Functionality

  1. All Keybindings  match screen, including the window-manager prefix-key.
  2. C-\ is the window-manager key.
  3. Switching windows speaks the title of the new window.
  4. Stumpwm command for displaying window list =C-\w= also speaks the output.
  5. The init file provides a simple lock-screen command bound to =C-\d=.
  6. Window manager messages speak automatically; this can be toggled with =C-\t=.
  7. If there is a lot of activity in a window that is not focused, turn off automatic speaking of messages using =C-\t= to avoid distraction.
  8. StumpWM is set up to deny raise-focus requests --- this is so that activity in a window doesn't automatically grab focus.
   I typically run with only one window displayed at a time.
